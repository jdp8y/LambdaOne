# LambdOne
This is repository for code to run on a Arduino robot. The robot is a sumobot with four breaks, one motor, two batteries, and a DC to AC inverter. The main board is a Arduino Uno, I will list the pins that the components are connected to along with the component's function(s) and a brief summary on the connections (i.e. pin 8 to Echo) on the wiki. All of the information seen in this document is avalibile in the wiki with greater detail.

### Build Status
This repository for LambdOne uses the standard software release cycle of (in order) Pre-alpha, Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate. Because of its release cycle when code is determined to be of a specific stage of release by the creator it can be moved into a different branch based on its stability.
